## Machine Learning: Regression

### Description
* Implemented Linear Regression and K Nearest Neighbors algorithm with Gradient Descent optimization to make an optimal model for predicting house prices using the Seattle King County dataset.
* Performed feature engineering and selection using Lasso and Ridge penalties to eliminate features with no impact on Residual Sum of Squares.
